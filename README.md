Breathing Timer -

If you don't know who Wim Hoff is then app won't make much sense out of the box.

Basically, it helps keep track of breathing times for a specific style of breathing exercise that improves oxygen levels.

This app is early in its development but I would be grateful for any feedback, suggestions or help.
